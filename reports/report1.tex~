\subsection*{Insights}
While implementing the algorithm we got a deeper understanding of its working. We understood how $head(i)$ and $head(i+1)$ relate to each other, and how the suffix links help us finding them.\\
To implement the algorithm we had to think a lot about string indices and what they mean. It was often very difficult to realize what the semantics of a given string index is, and which of the ones available should be used, added, subtracted etc. It helped to use clear variable names.

\subsection*{Problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item problems with string indices, off by one errors
  \item semantics of the intervals: now defined as [,)
  \item problems because we mixed values for where head(i) ends and tail(i) begins
  \item solved these by using two clearly labelled arrays
  \item variable names in pseudocode do not explain what they contain, had to invent better ones
  \item 
\end{itemize}
