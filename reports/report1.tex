\subsection{Insights}
While implementing the algorithm we got a deeper understanding of its working. We understood how $head(i)$ and $head(i+1)$ relate to each other, and how the suffix links help us finding them.\\
To implement the algorithm we had to think a lot about string indices. For example, the string index returned by slowscan has to be absolute in the string, not relativ to the edge, otherwise adding $tail(i)$ does not work properly.

\subsection{Problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item problems with string indices, off by one errors
  \item semantics of the intervals: now defined as [,)
  \item problems having the right indices when adding tail(i+1), it was difficult to get the right value for head(i+1) in all cases
\end{itemize}
